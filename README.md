I know its not recommended to add more projects to one repository but my CV will be more clean. Later on if projects will extend some volume they will get their own repository.

This project will never be finished.
It currently shows companies some of my qualities and technologies I used in the past or I am working with at the present time so they can determine a lot faster if I fulfill their demands.

Had to renew this repository - some bugs appeared. Its history of commits is lost but it will be updated anyway - so a clean documentation can still be witnessed.
